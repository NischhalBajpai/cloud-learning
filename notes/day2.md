## Day 2 - Cloud Computing Service Model

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: This allows you to rent cloud-based virtualized server/hardware environments.
    - Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: This allows for development and management of applications on a shared platform and allows for connection to other software systems.
    - Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: The consumer has access to the software over the web using an active subscription service.
    - Example: Gmail, Zoom, Dropbox

### Important differences to note:
- IaaS: You manage your own operating system, applications, etc..; however, the provider is supporting the physical hardware (service).
- PaaS: You need to write the application code (business logic); however, the vendor is managing (or supporting) everything the application is running on (infrastructure) and supporting the logic runtime.
- SaaS: You just consume the software, do not manage the infrastructure (application dependencies, etc...).
